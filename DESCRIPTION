Description: This package supports the calculation of dynamic floodplain maps.
    The package includes utilities for pre-processing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for watershed delineation and 
    Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) based calculations. The package also includes tools for replicating the standard-step
    approach to 1-D hydraulic calculations, and novel tools for combining the HAND method with the standard-step hydraulic calculations
    in order to produce more accurate floodplain maps.
Note: Package is in active development; please report errors and suggestions to maintainer.
