The code repository for the R package program version of Blackbird, developed by Heron Hydrologic Ltd. This version is primarily used for the pre-processing of geospatial data and preparation of input files for use with the compiled version of Blackbird.

Additional resources and links are available on the [Heron Hydrologic website](https://heronhydrologic.ca/blackbird/).

If you would like to work with the active development of Blackbird, please do so on a branch and coordinate with the Blackbird development team.
